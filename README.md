# American-Sign-Language-Fingerspelling-Recognition
The goal of this repo is to detect and translate American Sign Language (ASL) fingerspelling into text. 
You will create a model trained on the largest dataset of its kind, released specifically for this competition.
The data includes more than three million fingerspelled characters produced by over 100 Deaf signers captured via the selfie camera of a smartphone with a variety of backgrounds and lighting conditions.
